        When it came to the issue of nomenclature, the choice was inevitable.
        From the silver pages of history the golden utterances of Lokmanya Bal
        Gangadhar Tilak - eminent mathematician, great educationist and social
        reformer who gave magic mantra of 'Swaraj' laid the ideological
        foundation of the genesis of the Sanstha. The Sanstha founded in 1983
        has its gargantuan corpus of 30 institutions striving unceasingly
        towards excellence in education and building the cerebral infrastructure
        of India as a nation powered with its human resources. Its approach to
        education is an uncompromising pursuit of excellence through human
        resources.
